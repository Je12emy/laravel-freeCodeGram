# Designing the UI
Designing the UI doesn't much work since we will be using bootstrap to create our site, but I will be documenting a few keynotes.
- To import a new font head into `App.scss`, here fonts are imported using the Google Fonts API.
- After importing the desired font, you need to compile the frontend so run `npm run dev`
- The same would apply if you change the background color.
